# CongressDB
Repo containing documentation and implementation of a Congress Database.

Hi! Just a few things before you continue:
- The .zip file contains all items in a compressed form, but they're also available separately at the repo.
- The .png image depicts the Database Diagram in SSMS 18.4, given that a bug doesn't let users open a preexisting diagram and crashes the program.
- The report and documentation on the project is available on both .doc and .pdf for versatility.
- The ER diagram of the project is also available in various formats for versatility: .pdf and .drawio

If there's any questions, let us know so we can help you.

Sincerely,
- Santiago, Karen and Alejandro.
